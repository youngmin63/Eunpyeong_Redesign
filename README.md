# Eunpyeong Facilities Website Redesign

This project is a university web programming final assignment focused on redesigning the
official website of the Eunpyeong-gu Facilities Management Corporation to improve usability,
information accessibility, and overall user experience for local residents.

The website was designed and implemented using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, with a focus on
clear information architecture and simplified user interaction flows.

## Main Page Simplification

- Removed duplicated top and centre navigation menus
- Prioritised commonly used services and quick-access buttons

<div style="display:flex; justify-content:center; align-items:flex-start; gap:16px;">
  <img src="assets/main1 before.png" width="45%" />
  <img src="assets/main1 after.png" width="45%" />
</div>


## Programme Registration Flow

- Implemented dynamic search and filtering using JavaScript
- Improved visibility of programme lists without additional scrolling
  
<div style="display:flex; justify-content:center; align-items:flex-start; gap:16px;">
  <img src="assets/main2 before.png" width="45%" />
  <img src="assets/main2 after.png" width="45%" />
</div>


## Participation & Communication Section

- Introduced a tab-based interface for easier category switching
  
<div style="display:flex; justify-content:center; align-items:flex-start; gap:16px;">
  <img src="assets/main3 before.png" width="45%" />
  <img src="assets/main3 after.png" width="45%" />
</div>

## Clean Report Centre

- Simplified reporting steps into a single-page interaction flow

<div style="display:flex; justify-content:center; align-items:flex-start; gap:16px;">
  <img src="assets/main4 before.png" width="45%" />
  <img src="assets/main4 after.png" width="45%" />
</div>


# Overview

Public-sector websites often suffer from information overload and complex navigation.
This project addresses those issues by restructuring the website around user needs
rather than organisational structure.

The redesign includes improvements to the main page layout, programme registration flow,
community communication sections, and the civil complaint reporting process.

# Objectives

- Improve discoverability of frequently used public services
- Reduce cognitive load caused by excessive information on single pages
- Simplify complex user journeys (e.g. programme registration, reporting issues)
- Design a clearer and more intuitive information architecture

# Target Users

- Residents of Eunpyeong-gu
- Users of public facilities (sports centres, programmes, community services)
- First-time visitors to the public website

# Tech Stack

- HTML5
- CSS3
- JavaScript (Vanilla JS)

# Challenges & Solutions

## Challenge: 
Information overload and inefficient user flows

## Solution:
The original website attempted to present too much information on single pages, making it
difficult for users to locate key services.
To address this, content was prioritised based on frequency of use, duplicated navigation was
removed, and JavaScript-based interactions were introduced to streamline navigation without
adding complexity.

# What I Learned

- Building interactive webpages using pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
- Applying UX principles to public-sector websites
- Translating usability issues into concrete frontend improvements
- Structuring a frontend-focused project for academic and portfolio use
